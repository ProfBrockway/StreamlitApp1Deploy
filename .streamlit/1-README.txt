ABOUT THE STREAMLIT CONFIG FILE

 THE STREAMLIT CONFIG FILE IS NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT.
   SO I HAVE CALLED IT Blue_config.toml to prevent it executing.
     The problem is that the changes I wanted and put in the config.toml file 
     (change base appearance to blue) just doesn't work. It seems to have not effect whatever..

File config.toml in folder .streamlit in the project folder provideS streamlit configuration overrides.

# To generate a default config.toml file
