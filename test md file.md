## **Rules for over 62** 
http://bursar.uconn.edu/tuition-waivers-graduate-students/

Over 62 Waivers

This waiver pertains to any person 62 years of age or older who has been accepted for admission, provided this person is enrolled in a degree-granting program or, provided, at the end of the regular registration period, there is space available in the course in which the person intends to enroll. Students must be a Connecticut resident and 62 years old prior to the beginning of the term they wish to enroll in.  The waiver is only available for fall and spring semesters. For any person who receives a tuition waiver and also receives educational reimbursement from an employer, the waiver is reduced by the amount of the educational reimbursement. Some fee based programs may not qualify for this waiver. The senior tuition waiver does not apply to students in graduate certificate programs. Please contact bursar@uconn.edu for any questions.  For registration inquiries please contact the Registrar’s Office.

The tuition at the masters level is also free

https://bursar.uconn.edu/tuition-waivers-graduate-students/#

**UConn costs**

Free Courses at UConn & State Universities

http://nondegree.uconn.edu/senior.htm


My contact at UConn on this matter is Nichole Williams  Room 201

Bottom line is I can take courses for credit with out matriculations without paying tuition but it will cost about $185 per term in fees and fixed costs.

The fixed costs in the catalog can add up to $480 for a term if you are matriculate and taking a lot of courses but Non-Matriculated and just a few courses a term is much less.  

Online courses can also be taken by seniors without paying tuition under the same conditions but there will be the usual additional “online” fees.

\* Senior citizens may audit undergraduate courses on a non-credit basis for $15.00/semester provided there is space available.  Seniors citizens seeking a degree do not have to pay tuition, but university and activity fees do apply.

` `Contact Info  Hartford 860.570.9020

Questions:

`         `Can I take classes tuition free if I am not matriculated

`         `Can I be forgiven the university fees since I am a tutor.

`             `http://web.uconn.edu/undergradcatalog/13\_14\_catalog.pdf

`            `These fees seem to be about 37+234+30+75 = about $380 

`                          `= about $760 per year for two semesters.

General University fee of $37 each semester. 

Infrastructure Maintenance Fee. $234 each semester 

Student Government Fee.  $30 each semester 

Technology Fee $75 per semester

UConn Pirg fee:  $5 per semester

Online additional fees $20 per credit.


#
# **CCSU HOW TO APPLY**

**Senior Citiizen Waiver.**

Senior citizens attending the university as part-time students pay a $60 nonrefundable Registration Fee, Student Activity Fee, Lab Fee and Transcript Fee when taking any Continuing Education Courses. Senior citizens must be Connecticut residents and show proof of residency. Acceptable forms of identification needed to verify residency are:

Connecticut driver’s license or

Current automobile registration or

Federal and state income tax return.

**CCSU KNOWS I AM A SENIOR AND AUTOMATICALLY APPLYS THE WAIVER**

I only get charged "fees" typically $50-$100

After I've registered for a course I am emailed a bill (on my CCSU email) which contains full instruction on how to pay online.

`		`<https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/>


## **Python Code repostitory PyPi**
`	`<https://pypi.org/>

`	`A simple way to find code you may need. Also a location for "publishing" Python scripts as simple python script.

## **Python GUI Programming with Tkinter**
`	`<https://realpython.com/learning-paths/python-gui-programming/>

`		`Try TKinter. A GUI not a webpage so it can be run without a special backend server.

## **Use Anaconda**
`	`Anaconda sets up a lot of the most used Python Environments.

`	`So long as I am looking around its a quick way to use a lot of them without a lot of manual setup.

## **Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab**
`	`Didn't like them. Web based is good. But simple things like copy paste or navigating files very bad.

`	`Preferred Google colab. It's Jupyter based and integrated with my google storage etc.
